dialogbox
=========

Implement a page that includes a text area with some arbitrary text inside the text area. a. The user should be able to highlight any portion of the text. b. when the text is highlighted and the user releases the mouse, a dialog should pop up with 3 options "a","b" and "c" (including a close option in which case no action should be performed). If the user selects any of those options, then the text that the user selected should be wrapped with &lt;a>&lt;/a>, &lt;b>&lt;/b> or &lt;c>&lt;/c> depending on what was selected. As in option 1 you can use any available libraries or gems, or choose to implement this yourself
